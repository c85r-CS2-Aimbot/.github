## 🎯 What Is a CS2 Aimbot?

A CS2 aimbot is a cheat that automatically locks your crosshair onto enemy hitboxes—usually the **head, chest, or custom target zones**. You can configure how fast or smooth it locks on, how visible the player has to be, and whether it works with specific weapons only.

From **subtle legit configs** that pass as skill, to **rage setups** that snap instantly to domes—it’s all customizable. And it’s deadly 🔥
